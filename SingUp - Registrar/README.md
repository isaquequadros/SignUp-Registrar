The creation of a Web Design Developer portfolio is a fantastic way to showcase your work and the skills you've acquired through time.

Therefore I decided it was necessary to create an online portfolio where I could showcase my projects and work.


I used the following design tools to create this page: HTML and CSS.

These tools allowed me to create a webpage with interesting resources, such as a user registration form.

The form asks for information like a name, email address, and password in order to register, as well as an additional requirement that the user register with Google, Facebook, and Linkedin.


In addition, the registration page is responsive so that it may be accessed on any device.

This indicates that users can access the form. 

register anywhere, whether on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.


By the creation of this application page, I hope to have the chance to showcase my work and my design skills.

I'm eager to hear potential clients' opinions and learn about opportunities to advance my projects.
